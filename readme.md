# Copilot System Uptime Script

## Experience Using Copilot

### What code did Copilot generate?
Copilot generated a Python script (`copilot_test.py`) that prints the system uptime. The script automatically detects the operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) and uses the appropriate method to retrieve and print the system uptime.

### Did you modify the script? If so, why?
No significant modifications were neededâ€”the script generated by Copilot worked as expected for Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Minor formatting and documentation comments were added for clarity.

### How did you test it?
The script was tested on:
- **Linux**: The output correctly showed the uptime in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **macOS**: The script printed the output of the `uptime` command as expected.
- **Windows**: The script used the `net stats srv` command to show uptime since the last reboot.

### How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the script as `copilot_test.py`.
3. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
4. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python copilot_test.py
   ```
   The script will display your system's uptime in a human-readable format.

**Note:** Administrator privileges may be required for some commands, especially on Windows. If you encounter permission issues, try running the terminal as an administrator.
